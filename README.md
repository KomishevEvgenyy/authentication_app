<h1>User authentication app</h1>
<p>The application allows you to authenticate users whose data is stored in a 
text file with the name fileDB.txt<br>
Login and password are written to a text file according to this pattern.<br>
<b>username:your_name, password:your_password;</b>
</p>
<p> To run the application you need to start the server. To do this, install the server (Apache) on your computer. 
It takes up little space on the hard disk (several MB) and is very convenient to use (check scripts on your computer + no need for Internet access).
To do this, you need to download MAMP or another server convenient for you..
After installing it, go to the application folder and open the htdocs folder (if you have installed MAMP and are using MacOS) in which we create a folder in which this application will be located.
</p>
<p>Then open a terminal in the previously created folder and run the following command:<br>
тут будет команда для клони рования с репозитория
</p>
<p>Next, open the MAMP application and launch it. After starting the server, you will see in the address bar:<br>
http://localhost/8888:the name of the folder where you installed the application<br>
After going to this address, an authentication page will appear on your screen.
</p>
<p>To log in, use the logins and passwords written in the text file fileDB.txt</p>
